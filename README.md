# Simple_Python_Lines
Just a simple line drawing program I came up with the other day.
	My goal was to see what I could make with no outside knowledge on computer
graphics so my apologies if I'm using poor practices or incorrect terminology.
All you should need to run the program is python(3.5.2+) and numpy
