# Simple_Python_Lines
Just a simple line drawing program I came up with the other day.
	My goal was to see what I could make with no outside knowledge on computer
graphics so my apologies if I'm using poor practices or incorrect terminology.

All you should need to run the program is python(3.5.2+), numpy, pillow, and imageio.

This version: 6/1/19
-Moved the comments because they were bothering me when I was just trying to read the code (again)
-Added imageio to combine images into a gif after rendering them all
-Moved animation sequences into their own def
