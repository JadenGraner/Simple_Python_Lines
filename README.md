# Simple_Python_Lines
Just a simple line drawing program I came up with the other day.
	My goal was to see what I could make with no outside knowledge on computer
graphics so my apologies if I'm using poor practices or incorrect terminology.
All you should need to run the program is python(3.5.2+), numpy, and pillow

This version: 5/30/19
-Moved the comments because they were bothering me when I was just trying to read the code
-Added pillow so I could output an image of the lines drawn instead of a printed array
-added os so I could put the image above into the folder containing the program file
-added my name on the top for that clout
